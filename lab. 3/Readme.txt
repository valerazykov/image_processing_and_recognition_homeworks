Please install the DSE-skeleton-pruning library
(I couldn't put everything together in one .exe file using pyinstaller).
Write these commands in command line:

git clone https://github.com/originlake/DSE-skeleton-pruning/
cd DSE-skeleton-pruning
pip install .

Also see requirements.txt.
After that, you can run the program:

python main.py
